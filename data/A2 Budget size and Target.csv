Notes,,,,,,,,,
Budget size is the average size of social tranfers / taxes as a proportion of pre-tax (gross) income.,,,,,,,,,
Efficiency index ranges from -1.0 to + 1.0  (the poorest respectively the richest reciepient recieves all transfer income),,,,,,,,,
"Results for Hungary 2012, 2009 and 2007 should be treated with caution. We miss over 20% of the observations when we move from disposable income to primary income.",,,,,,,,,
"For some countries and years, private transfers are not available, including Canada (1997, 1994, 1991, 1987, 1981, 1975, 1971), Czech Republic (1996, 1992), Italy (1986), Norway (2013, 2010, 2007), Poland (1986), Romania (1997, 1995), Slovakia (1992), Spain (1985, 1980), Sweden (1981, 1967). Taiwan (1995) has no information on private transfers or social security transfers. Austria (1995, 1987) only has information on disposable income. For cases without information on private transfers, we calculate all incomes without adding private transfers.",,,,,,,,,
"Gross income data for most countries and years (194 datasets), while income data net of income taxes for 80 countries and years (marked italic).",,,,,,,,,
